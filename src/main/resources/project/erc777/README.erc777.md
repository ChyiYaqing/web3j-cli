# ERC777 project
This is a generated ERC777 project using the [Web3j-CLI](https://docs.web3j.io/latest).

## Important
This project is based on the [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) contracts.
This means that it requires an ERC1820 registry pre-deployed on the target network. More on this [here](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/simple-erc777-token-example/746).

We also provide support for ERC20. If interested, generate an ERC20 project using `web3j new erc20`.
